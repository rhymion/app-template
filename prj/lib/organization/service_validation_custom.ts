// GENERATED ONCE — safe to edit (will not be overwritten on regeneration)
// Custom save-time validation for organization.
//
// validateCustomRules() is called unconditionally from validateOnAdd()/
// validateOnUpdate() (see lib/organization/service_validation.ts), after the
// generated schema-driven checks (required fields, one-to-one uniqueness).
// Throw an Error to reject the save — the message surfaces to the caller
// (UI form or direct API request) as the save failure.
//
// `data` is the same raw create/update payload service_validation.ts
// receives, including every connect-style (many-to-many / optional-FK-list)
// child's selected id array under its property name (e.g. a self-ref m2m
// child exposes its linked ids as `data.<property_name>: string[]`) —
// see build_context.py's validation_data_obj for what is exposed.
//
// `prevRow` is the row as it stood BEFORE this write -- the full current
// record, fetched once in updateOrganization() and reused both for this
// call and (on entities with an x-approval edge trigger) the approval
// transition check, so it costs a single findUnique, not two. On create it
// is always null (there is no previous row to read). Use it to reject a
// save based on what a field WAS, e.g. "status may not change once it
// reaches 'closed'" -- something `data` alone (the submitted values) cannot
// answer. See app-generator's
// docs/knowledge/pre-edit-row-handoff-to-custom-validation.md for the
// mechanism.
//
// This predicate runs server-side only -- a UI that wants to disable the
// field being guarded here (rather than letting the user edit it and only
// failing on save) should export a second, plain function alongside this
// one, e.g. a synchronous `forbiddenFieldsFor(prevRow)` returning the field
// keys this rule currently locks, and call it from both this file and the
// client form. No such bridge is generated yet -- this note only keeps the
// door open.
//
// Default (unedited) stub is a no-op. Cast `tx` to your own Prisma
// transaction-client type as needed, e.g.:
//   import type { PrismaClient } from '@/app/generated/prisma/client';
//   type Tx = Omit<PrismaClient, '$connect' | '$disconnect' | '$on' | '$transaction' | '$use' | '$extends'>;
//
// Generator regression fixture (app-template is the designated testbed for
// this kind of test-only scaffolding -- it has no business living in
// app-generator's own generated output, which is exactly what motivated
// moving it here): an organization's description carrying the marker below
// may not be cleared. Scoped to that marker -- not "any non-empty
// description" -- deliberately: this generated entity's own standard
// Cypress CRUD spec (cypress/e2e/organization.cy.ts, "removes optional
// data and child items") always populates every optional field including
// description via db:populateOrganizationFull and then clears it as
// routine coverage that optional fields really are optional. A rule keyed
// on "any non-empty description" fires on that fixture data too and breaks
// a spec this file has no business touching; keying on a marker no
// generated fixture ever produces keeps the two fully independent while
// still genuinely exercising prevRow: "clearing an existing value" is only
// distinguishable from "never had one" by comparing the submitted value
// against what the row held BEFORE this write -- `data` alone (the value
// being submitted) cannot answer that on its own.
// See test/flows/pre_edit_row_custom_validation.test.ts for the real-DB
// regression test this line exists to keep green.
